# Dashboard Integration Complete

## Summary
Successfully integrated all dashboard sections to show consistent, real data from a unified API.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Enhanced Overview API (`/api/overview`)
- **Updated Structure**: Now provides comprehensive data for all dashboard sections
- **Portfolio Data**: Total value, invested amount, gains/losses, holdings
- **Transaction Data**: Total count, yearly count, taxable events, transaction types
- **Tax Information**: Estimated liability, realized/unrealized gains, tax status
- **Insights Data**: Performance metrics, monthly activity, asset distribution
- **Uses Portfolio Calculator**: Leverages existing portfolio calculation logic for consistency

### 2. Created Insights Dashboard Component (`components/insights-dashboard.tsx`)
- **Real Data Integration**: Uses actual transaction and portfolio data instead of mock data
- **Key Metrics Cards**: Shows total transactions, average transaction value, portfolio performance, tax status
- **Tax & Performance Insights**: Dynamic insights based on actual portfolio data
- **Asset Distribution Chart**: Visual representation of portfolio allocation
- **Monthly Activity Chart**: Shows transaction activity over time
- **Portfolio Summary**: Comprehensive overview of investment performance

### 3. Created Overview Hook (`hooks/use-overview.ts`)
- **Centralized Data**: Single source of truth for all dashboard data
- **Error Handling**: Proper error states and loading indicators
- **Auto-refresh**: Automatically fetches data when user changes
- **TypeScript Support**: Fully typed interface for all data structures

### 4. Updated Dashboard Navigation
- **Added Insights Section**: New insights tab in the dashboard navigation
- **Consistent Styling**: Matches existing dashboard design patterns
- **Proper Integration**: Uses the same navigation structure as other sections
