# Firebase Authentication Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the implementation of Firebase Authentication for the KoinFile crypto tax platform. The authentication system will provide secure user registration and login functionality using Firebase Auth with email/password credentials and Google OAuth integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Email/Password Authentication

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create an account using my email and password, so that I can securely access the KoinFile platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a valid email and password THEN the system SHALL create a new Firebase user account
2. WHEN a user provides an invalid email format THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
3. WHEN a user provides a password less than 6 characters THEN the system SHALL display a password strength error
4. WHEN a user successfully registers THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the dashboard
5. WHEN a user tries to register with an existing email THEN the system SHALL display "Email already in use" error

### Requirement 2: User Login

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to log in with my email and password, so that I can access my crypto tax dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides correct email and password THEN the system SHALL authenticate and redirect to dashboard
2. WHEN a user provides incorrect credentials THEN the system SHALL display "Invalid email or password" error
3. WHEN a user login fails multiple times THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate rate limiting
4. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL maintain their session across browser refreshes
5. WHEN a user clicks "Sign In" THEN the system SHALL show loading state during authentication

### Requirement 3: Google OAuth Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign in with my Google account, so that I can quickly access the platform without creating a separate password.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Continue with Google" THEN the system SHALL open Google OAuth popup
2. WHEN a user successfully authenticates with Google THEN the system SHALL create or link their Firebase account
3. WHEN a user cancels Google OAuth THEN the system SHALL return to the login modal without errors
4. WHEN a user signs in with Google for the first time THEN the system SHALL create a new user profile
5. WHEN a user signs in with Google on subsequent visits THEN the system SHALL log them into their existing account

### Requirement 4: Session Management

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want my login session to persist, so that I don't have to log in every time I visit the site.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL maintain their session using Firebase Auth tokens
2. WHEN a user closes and reopens the browser THEN the system SHALL automatically restore their authenticated session
3. WHEN a user clicks logout THEN the system SHALL clear their session and redirect to home page
4. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect them to login
5. WHEN a user accesses protected routes without authentication THEN the system SHALL redirect to login modal

### Requirement 5: User Profile Management

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want my profile information to be stored and accessible, so that the platform can personalize my experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers with email/password THEN the system SHALL store their full name and email in Firebase
2. WHEN a user signs in with Google THEN the system SHALL store their Google profile information
3. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL display their name in the dashboard header
4. WHEN a user updates their profile THEN the system SHALL sync changes with Firebase Auth
5. WHEN a user data is stored THEN the system SHALL ensure all data follows Firebase security rules

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when authentication fails, so that I understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL show "Connection error, please try again" message
3. WHEN the system is processing authentication THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them for debugging purposes
5. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL show success feedback before redirecting

### Requirement 7: Security and Validation

**User Story:** As a platform owner, I want robust security measures in place, so that user accounts and data are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users enter passwords THEN the system SHALL enforce minimum 6 character requirement
2. WHEN users submit forms THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all inputs
3. WHEN authentication occurs THEN the system SHALL use Firebase's built-in security features
4. WHEN storing user data THEN the system SHALL follow Firebase security best practices
5. WHEN handling sensitive operations THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication if needed
