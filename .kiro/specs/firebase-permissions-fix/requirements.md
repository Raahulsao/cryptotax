# Firebase Permissions Fix - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application is experiencing persistent Firebase Firestore permission errors despite attempts to update security rules. Users are unable to access portfolio data, transactions, or any database operations due to "Missing or insufficient permissions" errors. This spec addresses the systematic resolution of Firebase security rule configuration issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Firestore Security Rules Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want properly configured Firestore security rules so that authenticated users can access their data without permission errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user makes a database request THEN the system SHALL allow read/write access to their own data
2. WHEN security rules are updated THEN they SHALL be properly deployed and take effect immediately
3. WHEN rules are tested THEN they SHALL pass validation for authenticated user scenarios
4. IF rules deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback instructions

### Requirement 2: Rule Validation and Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate that security rules work correctly so that I can ensure proper access control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rules are deployed THEN the system SHALL verify they are active in the Firebase console
2. WHEN testing authenticated access THEN portfolio and transaction APIs SHALL return successful responses
3. WHEN testing unauthenticated access THEN the system SHALL properly deny access
4. IF rule syntax is invalid THEN Firebase SHALL provide specific error messages

### Requirement 3: Debugging and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and debugging information so that I can troubleshoot permission issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN permission errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including user ID and attempted operation
2. WHEN rules are evaluated THEN Firebase SHALL provide rule evaluation logs in the console
3. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL provide clear steps to verify rule deployment status
4. IF permissions fail THEN the system SHALL provide actionable troubleshooting steps

### Requirement 4: Fallback and Recovery

**User Story:** As a developer, I want fallback mechanisms so that the application can handle permission issues gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN permission errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear user feedback instead of generic 500 errors
2. WHEN rules are being updated THEN the system SHALL maintain service availability
3. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the system SHALL provide alternative authentication methods for testing
4. IF all else fails THEN the system SHALL provide manual rule deployment instructions

### Requirement 5: Documentation and Prevention

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation so that I can prevent and resolve similar issues in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rules are configured THEN documentation SHALL include step-by-step deployment instructions
2. WHEN troubleshooting THEN guides SHALL provide common issue resolution steps
3. WHEN setting up new environments THEN documentation SHALL include rule configuration checklists
4. IF issues recur THEN documentation SHALL include prevention strategies
